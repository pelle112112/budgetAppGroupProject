The project is being developed by group 5 team B. 

Budget App

We have decided to create a budget application which can keep track of the cost of an user's expenses. 
The application will give the user the possibility of entering how much money the make per month and see how much is left after all their bills have been paid. 
The user will be able to add, update and remove expenses, in order to make everything fit their budget and have the expenses shown on screen. 

The project is based on the React template using Vite. 

The expenses data will be persisted on a json-server and retrieved through regular REST API requests. 
We will have full CRUD operations to manage our expenses,
a http file to test the response we get from our requests, 
be using react Hooks, 
use the Fetch API to communicate with the json-server.
